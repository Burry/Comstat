Comstat
-------
Comcast forces you to go through a pretty crappy login process until they finally show you your data usage on a simple progress bar. This project uses Eric Swanson's [Python script](https://github.com/lachesis/comcast) to fetch the information from Comcast and then presents it in a nice front-end which...

  - You can host and share with your family or roommates
  - Doesn't require a login process, just set the config file
  - Can be easily expanded upon in the future with statistics and use predictions to make something much more useful than what Comcast provides
